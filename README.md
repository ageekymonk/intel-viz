For sharing data exploration findings.

We can add the web server and visualisations in due course.

My data explorations are in python, with a few charts output to output_chart/. My python is mostly using pandas. Feel free to use this or whatever other tools you like.

Please note that the visualisations are done on a small subset of the data. This is purely for prototyping purposes, do not take the visualisations as a real result.
